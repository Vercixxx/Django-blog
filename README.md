# Django-blog

I'am glad to publish my first Django project, which was my portfolio. In site you can find 3 tabs:
-  Forum 
-  CV
-  My projects
  
In Forum if you are logged in you can add a post, hit like or dislike button and also search thru posts.
In CV you can find my CV
In My projects you can find all of my Git projects that I am working on, and so finished ones.

What have I implemented in this project:

- register system with sending email to confirm account creation
- login system
- user rank system
- password recovery system with an email to confirmation
- user profile site where you can change username, email, password and see all of your posts
- you can see someone profile and his posts also, when you don't have an account
- you can add a post only when you are logged in
- you can edit/delete post if you are a creator of this post or if you have a rank of Moderator or Administrator
- you can add comments to posts, a comment can be deleted by comment author, post author, of if you have a rank of Moderator or Administrator
- you can add likes or dislikes to posts if you are logged in (1 per post)
- at the right-bottom corner you can find a button named "Contact me", that allows to send a message directly to me (a creator)
  
To do (known bugs):
- fix changing user photo
- fix password recovery validation
- fix user profile button in main site in single post
